# Product Requirements Document: Tether

## Introduction/Overview

Tether is an AI-powered learning platform that combines personalized tutoring, mastery learning, spaced repetition, and AI-facilitated study groups. The platform aims to replicate the benefits of one-on-one tutoring (addressing Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem) while incorporating community-based reinforcement learning principles.

The core philosophy is that effective learning requires both personalized guidance and collaborative reinforcement. Tether provides learners with an intelligent AI tutor for concept understanding and practice, automatic spaced repetition for long-term retention, and AI-moderated study groups for collaboration and accountability.

**Target Audience:** Adult learners with accessibility for all age groups across any subject domain.

## Goals

1. **Personalized Learning:** Provide adaptive, one-on-one AI tutoring that adjusts to individual learning styles and pace
2. **Long-term Retention:** Implement effective spaced repetition system to combat forgetting curve
3. **Community Learning:** Foster collaborative learning through AI-moderated study groups
4. **Accessibility:** Remove barriers to entry with guest mode and intuitive interface
5. **Engagement:** Maintain motivation through gamification and progress visualization
6. **Scalability:** Support any subject domain with AI-generated tailored learning plans
